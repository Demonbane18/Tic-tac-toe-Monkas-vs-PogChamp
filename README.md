# Tic tac Toe

A tic tac toe multiplayer game made using Javascript and HTML. 

## Instructions
You can join a game with random players or create a private lobby with a Room code and play with your friend.
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
You are PogChamp, your friend is monkaS. Players take turns putting their emotes in empty squares.
The first player to get 3 of his/her emotes in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
